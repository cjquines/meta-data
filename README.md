# meta-data

Data on pure-meta-styled puzzles from publicly available puzzlehunts. The main file is [src/metadata.yaml](src/metadata.yaml).

Browse random metas from meta-data on [my website](https://cjquines.com/meta-data/).

A "pure-meta-styled puzzle" expects the solver to combine several words and phrases (the "feeders") to create a new answer. The puzzle should has no content other than the feeders, and possibly flavor text, the puzzle title, and other small bits of info. It's a subjective definition and I'm using my judgment to determine what goes in and what doesn't.

Right now the index includes the MIT Mystery Hunt, Galactic Puzzle Hunt, and teammate hunt. I'm open to adding more as long as both puzzles and solutions are publicly available online, and the hunt has a stable URL. Contributions welcome.
